Can create random noise patters based on Name seed currently
Like this...

That's kind of pretty.

Also, have more GOL style generation starting now.
The latest one looks like this ...

There are now 6 colours of ground from the darkest brown which is 'low ground' to near white-grey which represents a high mountain.

Water has three depths, river, lake and deep lake. Rivers don't flow yet.

Light green is grass, dark green is trees. If there isn't any grass next to a lake, sand (yellow) can appear.

The name is now written with vectors so it works in environments where there isn't any fonts!
